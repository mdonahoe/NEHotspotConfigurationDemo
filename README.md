# NEHotspotConfigurationDemo

This sample code shows how to join (and leave) a WiFi network using `NEHotspotConfigurationManager` in iOS11+.

You need to add the "Hotspot Configuration" and "Network Extensions" capabilities to your xcode project.

See [ViewController.swift](NEHotspotConfigurationDemo/ViewController.swift) for all the logic.
